- [OneWeekNotice](https://github.com/OneWeekNotice) - Tested the 1.16.5 version.

I'm basing my mod off of another port which has been archived, [EmptyServerStopper](https://github.com/GHYAKIMA/emptyserverstopper-mod) by [GHYAKIMA](https://github.com/GHYAKIMA). I couldn't properly fork their project, they had some dual development setup for both Fabric and Forge, couldn't make any sense of it, so I decided to remake it myself and add some features.

## 🛠 TODO
- ~~Add config file.~~ **DONE**
- ~~Clean up files in repo (Organise folders into versions?)~~ **DONE**
- ~~Update 1.19 to v3.0.0~~ **DONE**
- ~~Finish 1.12.2 port.~~ **DONE**
- Redo the versions so that a single mod file supports all minor versions of a major version.
  - E.g. Get rid of 1.18.2 and replace it with 1.18 which supports all 1.18.X versions. Hopefully the forge devs didn't make too many drastic changes for each minor version.

## ⚠ NOTE ⚠
An issue came up where versions before 1.20.1 aren't working, most likely because the mod was coded using Forge 47.2.0. I will attempt to remake the mod for any other version that is requested (Just open up an issue) since the mod really isn't that hard to make.
